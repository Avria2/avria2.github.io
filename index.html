									<h1>Hi, I'm Linda Wang</h1>
									<p>Aspiring Software Developer</p>
									<body>
									<br>
										I'm a second-year double majoring in Computer Science and Data Analytics at The Ohio State University. I started attending Ohio State in Autumn 2018, and I'm expecting to graduate in Spring of 2022. I’m currently looking for a software engineering internship for Summer 2020.
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>I love computer science because it's a field that is always expanding.</b> One of my favorite things about this field is how fast it grows -- new frameworks and technologies pop up every year, and in turn, you never stop learning, and you never stop growing.
										<br>
										<br>
										This website serves as a career portfolio to showcase my work and provide some information about myself. Here's an overview of what can be found on this website.

									You can see some pictures of my work below, and download the actual program to try it out if you'd like. You'll need to have Java installed to run these, though. I use Java primarily, but also have experience in C/C++, Javascript, and other languages as well.

									With its lightweight interface, Polygon is easy to use. You can draw any kind of shape and see their data by double clicking on it on the list to the right. You can delete shapes you no longer want, as well. The program will automatically save and load when you exit and open it.
									<br>
									<br>
									You can download Polygon by clicking <a href="assets/Polygon.zip" download style="color: #61B9FF">here</a>. Just extract the .zip file, and run the .jar.

									Districts combines accessibility and functionality with its ability to easily manipulate large amounts of data. The program is pre-populated with a list of students, but can be adapted to work with anything from employees to sports players. There's no need to worry about unsaved changes, either, as the program will automatically save and load when you exit and open it.

									This project was completed as a part of my Technical Communication class. The purpose was to create an infographic that conveyed information to the reader. I worked on a group with two other people. Throughout the design process, we paid very careful attention to the elements of design, and how we could most effectively convey this information in a narrative format.

									<h2>Career Goals</h2>
								</header>

								<body>
									I’m currently looking for a software engineering internship for Summer 2020, where teamwork, diversification of talent, and Agile principles of customer satisfaction and flexibility are assets.
									<br>
									<br>
									I target internships because I enjoy making meaningful, tangible contributions to a team in a business environment. In both of my previous internships, I made tools for developers which helped them analyze crash reports or increase their speed of production. I found that the skills I mentioned previously were the most prominent at my internships.
									<br>
									<br>
									Being able to work on a team is an extremely important soft skill, as all projects in a production environment are simply too large for one person to handle alone. Working together and making sure that everyone is on the same page is something that I place heavy value on.
									<br>
									<br>
									Having a diverse portfolio of different languages, frameworks, and technologies is also important. Languages such as Java, C/C++, R, Python, .NET, etc. are common in many tech stacks. Working with a diverse tech stack is not only exciting -- it teaches you how to be familiar with a variety of technologies. A project is almost never limited to just one language.
									<br>
									<br>
									Agile was a methodology that my teams operated under at my past two internships. I thought it was an extremely effective one, as it is essentially a process that iterates on user feedback. Being able to get frequent user feedback helps shape a project, and virtually ensures that the final design and functionality of an application will meet the users' needs.
									<br>
									<br>
									As a student, it is my responsibility to learn as much as I can to prepare for entering the job market. I’ve always loved learning, and I’ve taken full advantage of the resources here at Ohio State University to do so. I’m double majoring in Data Analytics along with Computer Science, because I know that I will be able to apply my experience working with and analyzing large sets of data along with software development.
