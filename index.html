									With its lightweight interface, Polygon is easy to use. You can draw any kind of shape and see their data by double clicking on it on the list to the right. You can delete shapes you no longer want, as well. The program will automatically save and load when you exit and open it.
									<br>
									<br>
									You can download Polygon by clicking <a href="assets/Polygon.zip" download style="color: #61B9FF">here</a>. Just extract the .zip file, and run the .jar.

									<h3>I took my first CS class...</h3>
								</header>

								<body>
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...as a sophomore at William Mason High School. If I told my younger self that I'd be pursuing a career in it, she would think that I was joking. It was unlike any other class I had taken before up to that point, being more application than theory. While it took me a while to warm up to it, I eventually got the hang of programming. From there, I could only improve, and improve I did.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b style="color: #727272">Computer science became my favorite subject in high school.</b> In between the school years of Visual Basic, C++, and Java, I taught myself HTML & CSS during the summer. I earned an Outstanding Award in my AP Computer Science class, and graduated from high school in the top 5 percent of my class as a National Merit Finalist.

									<h3>Right now, I'm working...</h3>
								</header>

								<body>
									&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...towards a double major in Computer Science & Engineering and Data Analytics. I'm expecting to graduate in Spring 2022. It's crazy to look back and see how far I've come, and even crazier to see how far I have yet to go. 
									<br>
									<br>
									<b style="color: #727272">I love computer science because it's a field that is always expanding.</b> My education won't end when I graduate college, or even after I get a new job and complete training. I'll continue to learn on my own as well, whether it's by learning a new computing language or reading up on new developments in AI or machine learning.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b style="color: #727272">I'm learning MATLAB and polishing up my skills in C++ and Microsoft Excel right now.</b> I can't wait to look back and see how far I've come from here soon, too! By then, I'll have been able to add another skill to my toolset.
